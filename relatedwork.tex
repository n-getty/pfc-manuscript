\section{Related Work}
There are numerous other works on gene annotation, most focusing on the multi-label tasks concerning go-term or fun-cat annotation taxonomies. Such tasks relate genes with hierarchical term associations, i.e. terms have relationships and depth corresponding to levels of specificity. 

Rifaioglu et. al. \cite {1705.04802} developed a hierarchical aware deep-learning system trained on the Uniprot/Swiss-prot dataset with manual/experimental evidence. The authors propagates go term association via positive relationships to associate more terms per protein. They divide terms by level in the go directed-acyclic-graph and by number of protein associations to create 269 models for each ontology (cellular, molecular, biological). Sequences are featurized by using SPMAP, which clusters subsequences based on common associations.
